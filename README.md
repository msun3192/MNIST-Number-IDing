Final project for Algorithms
Human and AI approach to the MNIST dataset idenfication problem
AI clusters similar images, human identifies the centroid(average of all images)
Program prints out the images from the clusters and its performance rate(mine was 70% accuracy)
Many more improvements can be made, such as preprocessing images(centering)
